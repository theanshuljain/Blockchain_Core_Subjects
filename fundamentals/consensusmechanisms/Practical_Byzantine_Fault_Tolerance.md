# Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) Consensus Mechanism
## Core Concept
Replication algorithm that tolerates Byzantine faults through **multiple rounds of voting** among known validators.

## Technical Implementation
- **View Changes**: Sequential leadership rotation
- **Three-Phase Protocol**: Pre-prepare, prepare, commit
- **Quorum Certificates**: Collects votes from validators

## Mathematical Foundation
- **Safety**: Requires 3f+1 replicas to tolerate f faulty nodes
- **Liveness**: System progresses despite faulty nodes
- **Optimal Resilience**: Maximum faults = floor((n-1)/3)

## Process Flow
1. **Request**: Client sends request to primary node
2. **Pre-prepare**: Primary assigns sequence number and broadcasts
3. **Prepare**: Nodes verify and broadcast prepare messages
4. **Commit**: After 2f+1 prepare messages, nodes broadcast commit
5. **Reply**: After 2f+1 commit messages, execute and reply to client

## Message Complexity
- **O(nÂ²)**: Each phase requires all-to-all communication
- **Optimizations**: Various techniques to reduce message overhead
- **View Changes**: Protocol for replacing faulty primary

## Security Model
- **Byzantine Tolerance**: Handles arbitrary node behavior
- **Immediate Finality**: No block reorganizations
- **Known Validators**: Permissioned network assumption

## Advantages
- **Immediate Finality**: Transactions final in one round
- **High Throughput**: Thousands of transactions per second
- **Deterministic Safety**: Mathematical guarantees

## Disadvantages
- **Scalability Limits**: Poor performance with large validator sets
- **Sybil Vulnerability**: Requires permissioned setting
- **Complex Implementation**: Sophisticated protocol logic

## Implementations
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: Uses PBFT variant
- **Stellar**: Federated Byzantine Agreement
- **Zilliqa**: Hybrid PBFT and PoW
