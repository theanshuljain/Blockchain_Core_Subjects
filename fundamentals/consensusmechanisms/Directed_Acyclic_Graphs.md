# Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) Consensus Mechanism
## Core Concept
Non-linear structure where each transaction validates previous transactions, enabling **parallel processing** and **high scalability**.

## Technical Implementation
- **Tangle**: IOTA's DAG implementation
- **Hashgraph**: Leased patented DAG technology
- **Block-lattice**: Nano's account-chain structure

## Key Variants
### Tangle (IOTA)
- **Tip Selection**: Random walk algorithm chooses transactions to approve
- **Coordinator**: Temporary centralized checkpointing
- **Man**: IOTA 2.0 consensus without coordinator

### Hashgraph
- **Gossip about Gossip**: Nodes share their knowledge of transactions
- **Virtual Voting**: Deterministic outcome without sending votes
- **Famous Witnesses**: Events that achieve consensus

### Block-lattice (Nano)
- **Account Chains**: Each account has its own blockchain
- **Representatives**: Delegated voting for conflict resolution
- **Open Representative Voting (ORV)**: Real-time voting system

## Process Flow (Tangle Example)
1. **Transaction Creation**: User creates transaction with proof of work
2. **Tip Selection**: Randomly chooses two previous transactions to approve
3. **Validation**: Verifies approved transactions don't conflict
4. **Attachment**: Adds transaction to the tangle
5. **Confirmation**: Subsequent transactions provide cumulative confirmation

## Security Model
- **Cumulative Weight**: Security increases with network activity
- **Parasite Chain Attacks**: Addressed through tip selection algorithms
- **Double Spend Prevention**: Conflict resolution through voting

## Advantages
- **High Scalability**: Throughput increases with network size
- **Zero Fees**: No transaction costs in pure implementations
- **Fast Confirmation**: Sub-second finality potential

## Disadvantages
- **Security Concerns**: Vulnerable during low network activity
- **Complexity**: Sophisticated cryptographic requirements
- **Centralization Elements**: Some implementations require trusted nodes

## Implementations
- **IOTA**: Tangle implementation for IoT
- **Nano**: Block-lattice for feeless payments
- **Hedera Hashgraph**: Enterprise-focused DAG
