# Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus Mechanism
## Core Concept
PoW requires network participants (miners) to **solve computationally difficult puzzles** to validate transactions and create new blocks.

## Technical Implementation
- **Hash Puzzle**: Miners compete to find a nonce that, when hashed with the block data, produces an output below a certain target value
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Network automatically adjusts the target to maintain consistent block time
- **Longest Chain Rule**: The valid chain with the most cumulative computational work is accepted as truth

## Mathematical Foundation
```
Hash(Block Header + Nonce) < Target
```
where:
- **Target**: Maximum acceptable hash value
- **Difficulty**: Maximum target/current target

## Key Components
- **Nonce**: 32-bit number that miners increment to find valid hash
- **Merkle Root**: Hash of all transactions in the block
- **Previous Block Hash**: Links to previous block
- **Timestamp**: Current time
- **Difficulty Bits**: Encoded target value

## Process Flow
1. **Transaction Collection**: Miner gathers pending transactions
2. **Block Construction**: Creates block header with previous hash, Merkle Root, timestamp
3. **Hash Calculation**: Iterates through nonces to find valid hash
4. **Block Propagation**: Broadcasts valid block to network
5. **Validation**: Other nodes verify the hash meets difficulty requirements
6. **Chain Extension**: Network adds block to longest chain

## Security Model
- **51% Attack**: Attacker needs majority of network hashrate
- **Economic Security**: Cost of attack must exceed potential rewards
- **Probabilistic Finality**: Confirmations increase certainty of transaction permanence

## Advantages
- **Proven Security**: Bitcoin's 15+ years of operation
- **Decentralization**: Low barrier to entry for miners
- **Sybil Resistance**: Hardware and electricity costs prevent spam

## Disadvantages
- **Energy Intensive**: Massive electricity consumption
- **Slow Transaction Speed**: Limited transactions per second
- **Centralization Tendencies**: Mining pools and specialized hardware

## Implementations
- **Bitcoin**: Original implementation, 10-minute block time
- **Ethereum 1.0**: Used PoW before transitioning to PoS
- **Litecoin**: Uses Scrypt algorithm instead of SHA-256
