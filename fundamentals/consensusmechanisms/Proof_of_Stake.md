# Proof of Stake (PoS) Consensus Mechanism
## Core Concept
Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they **"stake"** as collateral.

## Technical Implementation
- **Staking**: Users lock coins to become validators
- **Validator Selection**: Algorithm chooses validators proportional to their stake
- **Slashing Conditions**: Penalties for malicious behavior

## Key Variants
### Chain-based PoS
- Validators take turns proposing blocks
- Selection probability proportional to stake
- Example: Peercoin (first PoS implementation)

### BFT-style PoS
- Validators vote on block validity
- Requires 2/3 majority for finality
- Example: Tendermint, Cosmos

## Ethereum 2.0 Implementation
- **32 ETH Minimum**: Required to become validator
- **Committees**: Validators randomly assigned to shards
- **Attestations**: Validators vote on block validity
- **Finality Gadget**: Casper FFG provides finality

## Process Flow
1. **Staking**: User deposits cryptocurrency to become validator
2. **Selection**: Algorithm randomly chooses validator for next block
3. **Block Proposal**: Selected validator creates and signs block
4. **Attestation**: Other validators verify and sign the block
5. **Rewards**: Validator receives transaction fees and block rewards
6. **Slashing**: Malicious validators lose portion of stake

## Security Model
- **Economic Security**: Attack cost equals value of staked funds
- **Nothing at Stake**: Solved through slashing conditions
- **Long-Range Attacks**: Addressed through weak subjectivity

## Advantages
- **Energy Efficient**: Minimal computational requirements
- **Scalability**: Higher transaction throughput
- **Economic Security**: Direct financial incentives for honesty

## Disadvantages
- **Wealth Concentration**: "Rich get richer" problem
- **Initial Distribution**: Relies on fair coin distribution
- **Complexity**: More complex than PoW

## Implementations
- **Ethereum 2.0**: Largest PoS implementation
- **Cardano**: Ouroboros PoS protocol
- **Tezos**: Liquid Proof of Stake
