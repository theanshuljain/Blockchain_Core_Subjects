# Proof of Space/Storage (PoSpace) Consensus Mechanism
## Core Concept
Validators prove they allocate **disk space** rather than computational power, creating more accessible mining.

## Technical Implementation
- **Plotting**: Precomputation of cryptographic proofs on disk
- **Challenges**: Random queries about stored data
- **Responses**: Quick proofs based on stored plots

## Process Flow
1. **Initialization**: Miner precomputes and stores cryptographic plots
2. **Challenge**: Network broadcasts challenge for current block
3. **Proof Generation**: Miner quickly generates proof from stored data
4. **Verification**: Network verifies proof validity
5. **Block Reward**: Fastest valid proof wins block

## Cryptographic Foundations
- **Graph Labeling**: Creating dependencies between stored elements
- **Proofs of Retrievability**: Demonstrating specific data is stored
- **Time-Space Tradeoffs**: Balancing storage vs computation

## Security Model
- **Storage Cost**: Attack cost proportional to storage capacity
- **Nothing-at-Stake**: Addressed through grinding attacks prevention
- **Long-Range Attacks**: Similar defenses as PoW

## Advantages
- **Energy Efficient**: Minimal electricity consumption
- **Hardware Reuse**: Standard hard drives sufficient
- **Decentralization**: Lower barrier to entry than PoW

## Disadvantages
- **Initial Plotting**: Time-consuming setup process
- **Storage Wear**: Constant reading may reduce drive lifespan
- **Centralization Risk**: Large storage farms possible

## Implementations
- **Chia**: Most prominent PoSpace cryptocurrency
- **SpaceMint**: Early academic proposal
- **Burstcoin**: First implementation of PoSpace concept
